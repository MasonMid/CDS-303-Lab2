# CDS-303-Lab2

For this lab we should be able to use the team notebook from lab 1, we will just need to change the name to 'teamnotebook_lab2' or something along those lines.

Note: For the team notebook you will have to remove any redundant information.
  ex. In notebook4 (Mason's) you will have to remove the first cell where the libraries are called since the libraries will be specified in the first notebook.
  
  Remember: If you use any libraries that aren't already specified in notebook1 you will need to make sure you include an import command for said library in notebook1
  
- First: make sure all notebooks and archive.zip file are saved in the same location (i.e. Downloads or another folder)

- Second: go through and make sure all notebooks use the same indexing. (i.e. if you call the cleaned set of data "clean_data" make sure in the other notebooks they use the same name when making graphs or editing the data)

- Third: test the team notebook as a whole. After you remove the redundant information each notebook will not be able to run on its own (except for notebook1).

- Lastly: submit team notebooks and individual notebooks! 


### Thank you for all your help!
